## Testing React native Installation 
 
<br>

### AwesomeProject

<br>

Use the React Native command line interface to generate a new React Native project called "AwesomeProject", then run react-native run-android inside the newly created folder
    
```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
react-native init AwesomeProject
```   

<br>

      To run your app on iOS:
         cd /Users/CaMnter/WebstormProjects/front-end-life/react-native/AwesomeProject
         react-native run-ios
         - or -
         Open ios/AwesomeProject.xcodeproj in Xcode
         Hit the Run button
      To run your app on Android:
         cd /Users/CaMnter/WebstormProjects/front-end-life/react-native/AwesomeProject
         Have an Android emulator running (quickest way to get started), or a device connected
         react-native run-android

<br>

```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
cd AwesomeProject
react-native run-android
```  

<br>
